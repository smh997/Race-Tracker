Race tracker app
=================================

The Race tracker app simulates the progress of two players in a race. The idea is to demonstrate 
basic concepts of Kotlin coroutines. A user can start, pause, or reset the race with buttons in the 
UI.
It's [one of the Jetpack Compose training projects](https://github.com/google-developer-training/basic-android-kotlin-compose-training-race-tracker/tree/starter).
